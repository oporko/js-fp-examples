A multiple-choice examination consists of 20 questions. Each question has five choices, labeled A, B, C, D
and E. All data for that exam is stored in a file exam.txt. The first line of data contains the correct
answers to the twenty questions in the first 20 consecutive (one after the other) character positions. For
Example:

BECDCBAADEBACBEDDBED

Each subsequent line in the file contains the answers for a single candidate. Data on a line consists of a
candidate number (an integer), then by one or more spaces, followed by the twenty answers given by
the candidate in the next 20 consecutive character positions. An X is used if a candidate did not answer
a particular question. A sample line is as follows:

5555 BECDCXACCAEDCBEDDACB

There can be an unlimited number of candidates. A line containing a “candidate number” 0 indicates
the end of the data.

A student’s final score is calculated by adding up the points awarded for all the questions. Points for a
question are awarded as follows:

* Correct answer 4 points
* Wrong answer -1 point
* No answer 0 points

Write a C# program to process the data in the file exam.txt and print a report that shows:

1. Each candidate number and their final score (the total points obtained by the candidate).
2. The total number of candidates
3. The number of correct responses to each of the 20 questions.
